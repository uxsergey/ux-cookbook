# Welcome
 
Hi, There! My name is Sergey. I'm a UX Designer, Mentor, and Visionary. Aside from my role as a UX Designer, I also serve as a mentor, guiding the future generations of UX professionals.

I would like to extend a warm welcome to you to my UX Cookbook. This is not just any cookbook, but the ultimate guide for anyone seeking to deepen their understanding of UX design. I have carefully curated and compiled all the essential knowledge, strategies, and insights that a UX designer would need to excel in this field.
